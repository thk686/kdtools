Title: Fast Sorting and Searching of Multidimensional Data
Version: 0.6.1
Authors@R: person("Timothy", "Keitt", email = "tkeitt@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Sorted data can be searched in logarithmic time using divide-and-conquer schemes. Here, we extend this idea to k-dimensional data to allow rapid range-queries and exact and approximate nearest-neighbor queries on data stored in matrices and data frames. A variant of the quick-sort algorithm rotates among dimensions to produce an implicit k-d tree ordering of the data. The package includes 'C++' code that can be used independently of 'R'. Representation of a binary tree in a sorted list is a common technique in computer science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_data_structure>. The original presentation of k-d trees can be found in Bentley (1975) <doi:10.1145/361002.361007>.
