## Notes

* I have updated all documentation to include description of the return values
* My appologies for not remembering why the last release was archived; I was terribly busy at the time; I suspect it was because the vignettes would fail when suggested dependencies were missing; I have fixed that with guards that stop chunk evaluation when packages are missing

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
